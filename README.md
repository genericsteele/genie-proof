Not Today, Genie
==================
Genies are terrible. This project aims to collect and phrase wishes that couldn't be misinterpreted by a genie. Inspired by [this thread](http://homeonthestrange.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=83&sid=021d8ae2fc5723bbd5e44cde40192044) which is inspired by _Home on the Strange_'s [Passionate Wishes, Part 2](http://www.homeonthestrange.com/view.php?ID=48).
